What is SQL? How important it is?
SQL Structured Query Language in RDBMS Relational Database Management System 
is a primary "Data Capturing" tool, and an important section to turn business questions into analytics questions.
Sometimes directly affect the feasibility of projects.
Critical in BA BI interviews

How to solve SQL problems?
1. Understand the question: What are the metrics?(e.g. How do to A/B testing using SQL?)
2. What data is needed? (Reverse thinking)
3. Where to obtain data? 
4. How to calculate with the obtained data?

What are the challenges during tech interview?
1. RDBMS, formed by 2-D tables and their connections in between.
Row and Column
A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.
A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table.
A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
Cell is 1-D
Join
2. Understand Business Situation
In the 1st question asked, try to understand the background info and ask questions to clarify
3. Express data needed in business with SQL
By practice and limit by time
4. Follow-Up questions
e.g. Why left join not inner join? Safe divide(AVOID Divide by 0?

Like and Wildcards
The LIKE operator is used in WHERE clause to search for a specific pattern in a column
2 wildcards in conjunction with LIKE:
% represents 0, 1, or N chars
_ represents single char

Aggregate Functions
Min(), Max(), Count(), Sum(), Ave()
How Count(), Ave(), Sum() handle NULL value?
1. Count()
If all values == NULL, return 0
If mixed NULL with not-NULL, ignore all NULL, COUNT all Not-NULL value
2. Sum()
If all == NULL, return NULL. If mixed, SUM all not-null value
3. Ave()
IF all == NULL, return NULL. If mixed, AVE all not-null value

Logic Query Processing
FROM --> WHERE --> GROUP BY --> HAVING and SELECT --> ORDER BY

Join
Single table has limited info. JOIN is used to combine or rows from 2+ tables
-> INNER JOIN
  # 从左边Table 1st row开始，根据on的条件，match右边Table所有的row,有多少,match多少；If no match, drop the entire row 
-> LEFT JOIN/RIGHT JOIN
-> FULL JOIN
-> Self Join(Special case)
